It lies in Penobscot co. in township No. 2, fifth range, between the Salmon and Moluncas rivers. The object of this purchase was to induce those among the Irish Catholics, who were desirous of purchasing small farms of from 50 to 100 acres, to settle together, as they could thus be more easily provided with a priest, and enjoy the benefits of their religion. The settlement promises well, and consists at the present time, of about thirty or forty families - and is daily increasing.

This beautiful edifice, erected by the contributions of the faithful, only a few years ago, was set on fire during the night of the 11th of May, 1838, by a band of fanatics in hatred of the Catholic religion, and reduced to ashes!  The Catholics in this district, 1000 in number, have now no place of worship in which they can assemble to pray, even, for their persecutors!  How long in a country, called free, is this state of things to continue!  
The citizens of the town of Burlington called a public meeting and appointed a committee to inquire into this unwarrantable act, and to report.  They did inquire, and in their inquiry found out more than they thought it prudent to report.  The fact is they will never report.  O land of freedom! shall we say that the respectable inhabitatnts connived at this horrid outrage, and that it is consequently a stain upon the entire city and country?
