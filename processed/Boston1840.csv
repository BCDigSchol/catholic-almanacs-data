It lies in Penobscot co. in township No. 2, fifth range, between the Salmon and Moluncas rivers. The object of this purchase was to induce those among the Irish Catholics, who were desirous of purchasing small farms of from 50 to 100 acres, to settle together, as they could thus be more easily provided with a priest, and enjoy the benefits of their religion. The settlement promises well, and consists at the present time, of about thirty or forty families - and is daily increasing.
